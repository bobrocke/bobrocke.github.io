I'm finding that I really like the syntax of Ruby and the philosophy of Rails. Both are straightforward and 'clean'.

PHP and Laravel are equally powerful, but their syntax is messy and strained. Laravel's philosophy is *explicit, rather than implicit* which is mostly the opposite of Rails' *convention over configuration*.

As much I as like Rails, and hope to continue using it, I don't think the documentation is a strong as Laravel's and there seems to be less community support for Rails. When I've gotten stuck, which has been **a lot**, I get unstuck more quickly with Laravel. Either I find the documentation explains it well or the community (by which I mean Stack Overflow) comes through.
