With so many good options for cloud-base hosting, it has taken me a while to find one to at least start with. With Reclaim Cloud's two week free trial, I can see what it's all about.

The reason I wanted to consider hosting beyond simple shared hosting was to have a solid way to experiment with Laravel and Ruby on Rails. My [regular WordPress blog](https://bobrockefeller.com/) is on Reclaim's shared hosting and it works just fine at just $35 per year.



My first step with cloud hosting was to install a WordPress environment and get my blog running there. And that lead to the first dead end. A simple setup on Reclaim Cloud can cost $5 a month, or less; one with a database (necessary for WordPress) adds at least an extra $5 per month. $10 per month is more than I plan to spend on a hobby hosting setup. So no WordPress or any other web site that requires a database.

Next up was to get my simple Ruby on Rails experiment (which uses only SQLite -- a server-less, file-based, database for simple things) running. More trouble. Errors trying to get ruby 3.2.2 installed sent me to technical support.
