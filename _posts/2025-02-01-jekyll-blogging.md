I've set this blog site up to be **dead simple**. I don't want to do anything to create it beyond installing Jekyll and setting it up to publish to GitHub Pages.
<!--more-->
No theme writing, no theme customizing (OK, maybe just a little), no plug-in writing, no nothin'.

I'm even using the default theme so I need not do any theme hunting, testing, or fixing. I can just write.

My writing is going to be simpler here, too. Few, if any, images mean I don't have to take the time to find or create them and then get them posted. Jekyll uses Kramdown formatting --- which is based on Markdown (thanks John Gruber) --- and is simple and easy to remember, even if it doesn't provide for many frills. But it does code blocks and code syntax highlighting well.

There is also little need for me to spend time creating links to everything I mention. It's just too easy these days for you to copy a word or phrase and Google it. For more obscure stuff, or citations, I'll still link in the text.

No comments mean no need to guard from robots and spam. That might mean a little less engagement, but my email address is available for those who truly have something to say.

After I've written a post, all I have to do is commit the changes to my local repository, push them to my GitHub account, and I'm done.

**Dead Simple**
