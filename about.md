I've been blogging on and off for many years and with a number of content management systems (CMS) platforms. I write about my hobbies -- photography, competition shooting, and web development. This site is my opportunity to write about my experiences with web development with as little friction as possible. Maybe that will make me more likely to write instead of goof off.
