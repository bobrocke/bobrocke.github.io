I'm Bob Rockefeller and I've been blogging on and off for many years using a number of content management systems (CMSs). I write about my hobbies -- photography, competition shooting, and web development. This site is my place to discuss my experiences in web development with as little friction as possible. Maybe that will make me more likely to write instead of goof off.
